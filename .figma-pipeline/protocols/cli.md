# `figma-code-composer` CLI surface (v1.0)

> Authoritative spec for the `fcc` binary. As of v0.1.0 **every subcommand below is implemented** in `bin/figma-code-composer.js` — `init`, `doctor`, `complexity`, `kg:query`, `kg:stage`, `kg:merge`, `kg:rebuild`, `kg:verify`, `kg:repair`, `handover`.

> **Implementation notes (stdlib-only, zero npm dependencies):**
> - **Embeddings** — the spec describes `embeddings.sqlite` (sqlite-vec). The shipped build uses `embeddings.json` with a **local bag-of-words term-frequency vector + cosine similarity** computed in pure Node. This keeps the package dependency-free and makes `kg:query` work offline with no API keys. The exact-match instance-reuse path (`kg:query --figma-node-id`) — the load-bearing reuse mechanism — is an exact ledger lookup and does not depend on embeddings at all. Semantic RAG (`--slice`) uses the local vectors; quality is lower than a neural embedding but sufficient for "is there a similar prior component?" hints. Swapping in `openai`/`voyage` providers (opt-in, network) is a future additive change.
> - **Lock** — the spec says `flock(2)`. Node has no built-in flock, so `kg:merge` / `kg:repair` use an **atomic `open(…, "wx")` lockfile** at `<storeDir>/ledger.lock` with a 30s timeout. Same single-writer guarantee; portable across platforms.
> - **Merge is upsert-by-id** — re-staging an entry with an existing `id` (tokenSets, rebuilt components) replaces it and preserves the original `createdAt`.

The CLI is shipped exclusively via the npm package — consumer projects never import from it. Agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) drive the CLI via `Bash` tool calls. The binary name is `figma-code-composer`; the short alias is `fcc`.

### `fcc migrate`

One-time migration for projects scaffolded **before the ownership split** (when `CLAUDE.md` carried the binding rules / repo map / coverage / quick-start inline). Those now live in `.figma-pipeline/PIPELINE.md`, imported via a managed marker block — so the inline copy is redundant.

**Effect:**
- Detects an old-style `CLAUDE.md` (fingerprint: a `## Binding rules` heading + the rule-1 text, no managed block).
- Backs it up to `CLAUDE.md.bak`, removes the superseded sections (`## Quick start`, `## Repo map`, `## Binding rules`, `## Coverage`), and ensures the `@.figma-pipeline/PIPELINE.md` managed block is present. Your own sections (anything not in that set) are preserved.
- `AGENTS.md`: lighter — just ensures the managed pointer block exists.
- Idempotent: a file that already has the managed block reports "already migrated".

**Flags:**

| Flag             | Effect                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `--target <dir>` | Project dir (default: cwd)                        |
| `--dry-run`      | Print the plan (sections to remove); write nothing |
| `--yes, -y`      | Skip the confirmation prompt                      |

**Exit codes:** `0` migrated (or already-migrated / dry-run) · `1` user declined the prompt.

### `fcc init [target]`

Scaffold the pipeline into a project. (Default when no subcommand given, for backward compatibility.)

**Flags:**

| Flag                | Effect                                                   |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--target <dir>`    | Target directory (default: positional arg or cwd)        |
| `--tools <list>`    | Comma-separated: `claude`, `cursor`, `codex` (default: all) |
| `--skip <list>`     | Skip extras: `claude-md`, `agents-md`                    |
| `--force`           | Overwrite existing files                                 |
| `--dry-run`         | Print plan, write nothing                                |
| `--yes, -y`         | Skip prompts; use defaults                               |

**Exit codes:**
- `0` — scaffold installed (or dry run completed)
- `1` — user aborted or conflicts un-resolved
- `2` — invalid flag / unknown tool / target not a directory

---

### `fcc doctor`

Validate the local configuration, MCP reachability, and RTK detection.

**Effect (read-only):**
- Read `.figma-pipeline/config.json`. Validate against `config.schema.json`.
- Print resolved output-structure tree (where each generated artifact will land).
- Check `rtk` binary on PATH. Update `config.rtk.installed` + `config.rtk.version` if changed (writes config.json).
- Check Figma MCP reachability via `mcp__figma__get_metadata` if available; if not, print the manual check.
- Check `.figma-pipeline/kg/` directory health (sqlite-vec readable, ledger.jsonl parseable, no orphan staging dirs).

**Flags:**

| Flag                  | Effect                                                |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `--explain-output`    | Print the resolved output-structure tree only         |
| `--no-write`          | Don't update config.rtk; doctor is fully read-only    |
| `--mcp-skip`          | Skip MCP reachability check                           |

**Exit codes:**
- `0` — all green
- `1` — at least one warning (output, not blocking)
- `2` — config invalid or unreadable
- `3` — MCP unreachable when reachability check enabled

---

### `fcc complexity <manifest>`

Compute and print the complexity score + tier for a manifest JSON file. See [complexity.md](./complexity.md).

**Effect (read-only):**
- Read the manifest at `<manifest>` path.
- If `config.knowledgeGraph.enabled = true`, query the KG for `tokenReuseRatio`.
- Apply the formula; resolve tier against `config.complexity.thresholds`.
- Apply `config.complexity.tierOverrides`.
- Print JSON: `{ score, tier, signals, model, skills }`.

**Flags:**

| Flag                 | Effect                                          |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `--no-kg`            | Skip the KG query; assume `tokenReuseRatio = 0` |
| `--print-routing`    | Also print the resolved skill set + model       |

**Exit codes:**
- `0` — score computed
- `2` — manifest unreadable or invalid

---

### `fcc kg:query`

Retrieve top-K most-similar prior ledger entries for a manifest slice. See [knowledge-graph.md](./knowledge-graph.md).

**Effect (read-only):**
- Read the slice at `--slice <path>`.
- Embed `slice.summaryHint` via the configured provider.
- Query `embeddings.sqlite` for top-K by cosine similarity.
- Print JSON array of ledger entries sorted by similarity descending.

**Flags:**

| Flag                 | Effect                                                |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `--slice <path>`     | REQUIRED — path to a slice JSON                       |
| `--top-k <n>`        | Default 5; max 20                                     |
| `--min-similarity <0..1>` | Default 0.3; drop entries below this threshold   |

**Exit codes:**
- `0` — query executed (zero results is success)
- `2` — slice unreadable
- `3` — KG store missing or corrupt

---

### `fcc kg:stage`

Append one ledger entry to a subagent's staging file. Called by each builder after it writes its files.

**Effect (writes, isolated):**
- Validate `--entry` against the ledger entry schema.
- Append a single line to `staging/<runId>/<agent>.jsonl`.
- No cross-agent interaction; no lock needed (each agent owns its own file).

**Flags:**

| Flag                 | Effect                                              |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `--run-id <id>`      | REQUIRED                                            |
| `--agent <name>`     | REQUIRED — e.g. `component-builder`                 |
| `--entry <json>`     | REQUIRED — entry as JSON string, OR `--entry-file <path>` |
| `--entry-file <path>`| Alternative to `--entry`                            |

**Exit codes:**
- `0` — staged
- `2` — schema validation failure
- `3` — staging dir unwritable

---

### `fcc kg:merge`

Atomically merge all staged deltas for a run into `ledger.jsonl`. Called by the coordinator after all parallel builders return.

**Effect (writes, locked):**
- Acquire `flock` on `ledger.jsonl`.
- For each `staging/<runId>/*.jsonl`, validate entries, then append.
- Rebuild `graph.json` from the new ledger state.
- Re-embed new `summary` fields into `embeddings.sqlite`.
- Delete `staging/<runId>/`.
- Release lock.

**Flags:**

| Flag                 | Effect                                              |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `--run-id <id>`      | REQUIRED                                            |
| `--dry-run`          | Validate + report what would happen; write nothing  |

**Exit codes:**
- `0` — merged (or dry-run validated)
- `2` — at least one staged entry invalid; nothing merged
- `3` — could not acquire lock within 30s
- `4` — embeddings provider failed (ledger merged, embeddings will need `fcc kg:rebuild`)

---

### `fcc kg:rebuild`

Rebuild `graph.json` and `embeddings.sqlite` from the current `ledger.jsonl`. Run manually if the derived files drift.

**Effect:**
- Reads every entry in `ledger.jsonl`.
- Rebuilds `graph.json` from `composes`, `tokensUsed`, `iconsUsed` edges.
- Drops and re-creates `embeddings.sqlite`; re-embeds every entry's `summary`.

**Flags:** none beyond global.

**Exit codes:**
- `0` — rebuilt
- `2` — `ledger.jsonl` unreadable or contains invalid entries

---

### `fcc kg:verify`

Check that ledger entries still match the filesystem. Used by the coordinator before any silent reuse, and at the end of every run; also runs as part of `fcc doctor`.

**Effect (read-only):**
- For each ledger entry (or just `--component-id <id>` when targeted), verify:
  - `filePath` exists.
  - For components/icons: the file contains a named export matching `exportName`.
  - For components: `storyPath` and `testPath` (if set) exist.
  - For tokenSets: each `tokens[].emittedIn` file exists and contains `tokens[].emittedAs`.
- Any failed entry is flagged `orphaned: true` + `orphanedAt: <ISO-8601>` (writes to the ledger; this is the one read-mostly mode where verify mutates).

**Flags:**

| Flag                    | Effect                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--all`                 | Verify every ledger entry                               |
| `--component-id <id>`   | Verify just this entry                                  |
| `--no-write`            | Read-only — don't mutate the ledger even if orphans found |

**Exit codes:**
- `0` — all checked entries verified clean
- `1` — at least one orphan flagged (run continues; report includes the orphan list)
- `2` — `ledger.jsonl` unreadable

---

### `fcc kg:repair`

User-driven cleanup. Never called by agents — only by the user when the run report flags orphans.

**Subcommands:**

| Subcommand                                       | Effect                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--prune-orphans`                                | Confirms then removes orphaned entries; writes archive to `.deleted.jsonl` |
| `--prune-orphans --where '<expr>'`               | Same, scoped to entries matching a JSONPath-like expression (e.g. `'framework != "vue"'`) |
| `--rebuild-from-source`                          | Re-runs figma-fetcher + builders for orphaned entries (requires Figma MCP) |
| `--resolve-path <id> <newPath>`                  | Updates `filePath` for a moved file; verifies the new path contains `exportName` |

**Flags:**

| Flag                    | Effect                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--yes, -y`             | Skip confirmation prompts                               |
| `--dry-run`             | Print what would happen                                 |

**Exit codes:**
- `0` — repair applied (or dry-run completed)
- `1` — user declined the action
- `2` — invalid expression or path arguments
- `3` — ledger lock could not be acquired

---

### `fcc handover`

Emit a `handovers/<runId>.md` summarizing a run. Called by the coordinator after `fcc kg:merge` succeeds. See [handover.md](./handover.md).

**Effect:**
- Reads the manifest at `--manifest`.
- Reads merged ledger entries for the run.
- Writes the handover Markdown.

**Flags:**

| Flag                  | Effect                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `--run-id <id>`       | REQUIRED                                          |
| `--manifest <path>`   | REQUIRED — path to the run's manifest             |
| `--output <path>`     | Default: `<storeDir>/handovers/<runId>.md`        |
| `--costs <path>`      | Per-specialist cost ledger. Default: `/tmp/figma-<runId>/costs.jsonl` |
| `--failed`            | Emit a `.failed.md` instead of `.md`              |
| `--verify`            | Re-read disk state and cross-check ledger; flag drift |

The handover embeds a **Cost (this run)** table aggregated from the cost ledger (`costs.jsonl`) — one JSON line per specialist spawn (`{ agent, model, totalTokens, toolUses, status }`), written by the coordinator (single writer). Front-matter gains `specialistTokensThisRun` + `specialistToolUsesThisRun`. Absent ledger → the section notes it; the rest of the handover is unaffected.

**Exit codes:**
- `0` — handover written
- `1` — written with warnings (use `--verify` to surface)
- `2` — manifest or ledger unreadable

### `fcc skills:prune`

Guarded prune of `.figma-pipeline/skills/` down to a keep-set. The vetted replacement for hand-authored `rm -rf` in the wizard's install phase (a shell word-splitting bug in such a command once wiped the entire catalog). Called by the wizard at `/init-figma-compose` (Step 7.5) with the resolved `installSet`. See [skills.md](./skills.md) § _Resolution algorithm — Wizard (install phase)_.

**Effect:**
- Lists directories directly under `.figma-pipeline/skills/`.
- Deletes those NOT in `--keep`. Each target is basename-scoped and confirmed to resolve under the skills dir.
- Best-effort syncs `skills-lock.json` to the surviving set (if present).

**Flags:**

| Flag                  | Effect                                                            |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--keep <list>`       | REQUIRED — comma-separated skill names to keep (the `installSet`) |
| `--dry-run`           | Print what would be removed; delete nothing                       |
| `--json`              | Machine-readable output (`{ pruned, kept, total, removed, missing, lockSynced }`) |

**Guards (non-bypassable):**
- Empty/missing `--keep` → refuse (exit 2). An empty keep-set would delete everything.
- `--keep` disjoint from the on-disk set → refuse (exit 3). That would delete the whole catalog — the historical failure mode.
- Keep entries containing `/`, `\`, `.`, or `..` → refuse (exit 2).

**Exit codes:**
- `0` — pruned (or nothing to prune)
- `2` — bad input (empty/unsafe `--keep`, no skills dir)
- `3` — guard tripped (disjoint keep-set) or out-of-scope target

## Exit-code conventions (summary)

- `0` — success
- `1` — soft warning, work done
- `2` — bad user input (flags, files)
- `3` — system / external state problem (lock, MCP, sqlite)
- `4` — partial success (intentional fallback path)

Agents that call the CLI MUST treat non-zero as a build failure unless the spec above explicitly allows otherwise.

## What the CLI does NOT do

- **No network**: doctor's MCP check uses the local MCP server. Embedding `provider: local` runs locally. `openai`/`voyage` providers call out — opt-in only.
- **No `git` operations**: never commits, pushes, branches. The CLI writes files; the user controls version control.
- **No `npm publish` or `gh repo create`**: outside scope.
- **No source-file mutations**: only writes to `config.knowledgeGraph.storeDir`, and (for `doctor` only, with consent) `config.json`.

## Versioning

The CLI follows semver. `--version` prints the package version. Subcommand contracts here are versioned with the protocol docs (e.g., this doc is `v1.0`). Breaking changes bump major; additive flags bump minor; bug fixes patch.

Protocol docs and CLI version stay aligned — `fcc --version` printing `1.0.x` means it implements `protocols/cli.md` v1.0.
