First release — a drop-in, framework-agnostic Figma→code pipeline scaffold for **Claude Code** and **Cursor**.

`npx figma-code-composer` copies a multi-agent pipeline into any frontend repo: a Figma file becomes design tokens, framework-native components, icons, Storybook stories, and tests — with a built-in knowledge graph that reuses components across screens instead of duplicating them. Nothing is bundled into your app; the CLI runs on demand.

**Pipeline output**

- Design tokens in your CSS system's native format (CSS vars, Tailwind theme, Panda config, …), with Figma variable names preserved (never resolved to raw values).
- Framework-native components (React TSX / Vue SFC / Angular standalone / Svelte) with cva-style variants and accessibility baked in.
- Icons: SVG → component with `currentColor` / literal fills + barrel re-exports.
- Storybook stories + unit tests (Vitest / Jest / Karma) and optional Playwright E2E.

**Coverage**

- **Frameworks** — React (Next · Vite · Remix · Astro · CRA), Vue 3 (Nuxt · Vite · Astro), Angular ≥17 (standalone + signals), Svelte 5 (runes).
- **CSS** — Tailwind v4/v3, UnoCSS, vanilla CSS-vars, CSS Modules, Sass/SCSS, vanilla-extract, Panda, styled-components.
- **Design systems** — Atomic, Ant Design, Chakra, Hero UI, Mantine, MUI, Radix, shadcn/ui, or none/custom.
- **Methodologies** — Atomic Design, Feature-Sliced, Component-Based, Flat/custom.

**Pipeline intelligence**

- Knowledge graph records every built component and reuses it across screens (exact + semantic match) instead of rebuilding duplicates.
- Complexity routing picks the smallest viable model + skill set per build — saving tokens on easy designs without sacrificing quality on hard ones.
- Handover summaries let you `/clear` between runs and re-hydrate from the handover + KG.
- ~137 bundled skills, auto-pruned to your chosen stack by the wizard.
- `fcc` CLI: knowledge-graph query/stage/merge, handover, complexity, and `doctor` health check.

**Setup & safety**

- One-time `/init-figma-compose` wizard detects your stack, hard-gates on a reachable Figma MCP, derives the write allowlist, and writes `.figma-pipeline/config.json` (the single source of truth every agent reads).
- A `config.json`-driven write allowlist plus lifecycle hooks keep generation scoped to your configured output directories; `.env` is hard-blocked, and all Figma-derived strings are treated as data (prompt-injection guard).
- `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` get a managed marker block only — your own instructions survive updates.
- Optional, detect-only (never auto-installed): Graphify knowledge graph and RTK shell-output compression.

Tooling note: this release supports **Claude Code and Cursor**. Codex CLI was evaluated and removed — its Figma plugin tools are not available to `codex exec`, so the pipeline could not run there.
